In this tutorial, we'll go through the entire process of evaluating a legal document summarizer, from choosing your metrics to running evaluations and monitoring performance in production.

:::tip  
If you're working with LLMs for summarization, this tutorial is for you. While we focus on evaluating a legal document summarizer, the concepts apply to **any LLM application that generates summaries**.

:::

We'll cover:

- How to define summarization criteria
- Selecting the right summarization metrics
- Running evaluations on your summarizer
- Iterating on your summarizer’s hyperparameters
- Monitoring and evaluating LLM summarizers in production

## Legal Document Summarizer

The LLM summarizer application we'll be evaluating is designed to **extract key points** from legal texts while maintaining their _original intent_. This ensures that important clauses, obligations, and legal nuances are preserved without unnecessary details or misinterpretation.

:::info
We'll be using GPT-3.5 to generate these summaries. Below is the prompt template that will be guiding the model:

```
You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing legal documents
concisely and accurately. Given the following legal text, generate
a summary that captures the key points while avoiding unnecessary
details. Ensure neutrality and refrain from interpreting beyond the
provided text.
```

Now that we've established the context for our summarizer, let's move on to [defining our evaluation criteria](legal-doc-summarizer-defining-a-summarization-criteria) in the next section.
