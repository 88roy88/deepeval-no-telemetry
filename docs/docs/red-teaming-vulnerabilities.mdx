## Vulnerabilities

DeepEval allows you to scan for **40+ types of vulnerabilities**, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential risks within your LLM application. These vulnerabilities fall into five key LLM risk categories:

- Responsible AI Risks
- Illegal Activities Risks
- Brand Image Risks
- Data Privacy Risks
- Unauthorized Access Risks

:::tip
While all of these LLM risk categories should be addressed, **focusing on your most critical concerns** can be a more effective use of resources. Prioritizing areas that pose the highest risks to your organization, such as data privacy or brand image, helps ensure targeted mitigation while maintaining overall security and compliance.
