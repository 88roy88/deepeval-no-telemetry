import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The deep acyclic graph (DAG) metric in `deepeval` is a custom metric for you to easily build deterministic decision trees for evaluation with the help of using LLM as a judge.

:::info
Tge `DAGMetric` is a custom metric and gives you more control over `GEval`.

## Required Arguments

To use the `DAGMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`

You'll also need to supply any additional arguments such as `expected_output` and `tools_called` if your evaluation criteria depends on these parameters.

## Building Your Decision Tree

The `DAGMetric` requires you to first construct a decision tree that has direct edges and acyclic in nature. Let's take this decision tree for example:

[image here]

We can see that we first process the `actual_output` of an `LLMTestCase` to extract all headings, before deciding whether they are in the correct ordering. If they are not in the correct ordering, we give it a score of 0, heavily penalizing it, whereas if it is in the correct ordering, we

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = FaithfulnessMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are seven optional parameters when creating a `FaithfulnessMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `truths_extraction_limit`: an int which when set, determines the maximum number of factual truths to extract from the `retrieval_context`. The truths extracted will used to determine the degree of factual alignment, and will be ordered by importance, decided by your evaluation `model`. Defaulted to `None`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `FaithfulnessMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Faithfulness} = \frac{\text{Number of Truthful Claims}}{\text{Total Number of Claims}}" />

The `FaithfulnessMetric` first uses an LLM to extract all claims made in the `actual_output`, before using the same LLM to classify whether each claim is truthful based on the facts presented in the `retrieval_context`.

**A claim is considered truthful if it does not contradict any facts** presented in the `retrieval_context`.

:::tip
Sometimes, you may want to only consider the most important factual truths in the `retrieval_context`. If this is the case, you can choose to set the `truths_extraction_limit` parameter to limit the maximum number of truths to consider during evaluation.
