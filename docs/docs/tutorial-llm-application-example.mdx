## Quick Summary

In this tutorial, we will be developing an **Agentic RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) medical chatbot that records symptoms, diagnoses patients, and schedules medical appointments. We'll be building our RAG engine from a medical encyclopedia for diagnosis, along side function-calling tools to help with information recording. For the full code, please skip to [this section](#full-code-example).

:::information
You may use whatever medical **knowledge base** you have to build your RAG Engine, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be using [The Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine](https://staibabussalamsula.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Gale-Encyclopedia-of-Medicine-3rd-Edition-staibabussalamsula.ac_.id_.pdf).
:::

## 1. Setting Update

Begin by installing the necessary packages. We'll use `llama-index` as our framework and `chromadb` to store our knowledge base:

```bash
pip install llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-chroma doc2text chromadb
```

Since our chatbot will be recording a lot of information, we’ll need a structured way to store this data. We'll define a `pydantic` model with the relevant fields (symptoms, diagnoses, and personal information), ensuring our agent can **accurately store data in the appropriate format**.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class MedicalAppointment(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str] = None
    email: Optional[str] = None
    date: Optional[str] = None
    symptoms: Optional[str] = None
    diagnosis: Optional[str] = None
```

Finally, we'll need to define a class, `MedicalAppointmentSystem`, to represent our agent. We'll be storing all of our `MedicalAppointment`s inside the `appointments` dictionary, where each key represents a unique user. Throughout this tutorial, we'll keep adding to this class until it becomes a fully functional medical chatbot agent.

```python
class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.appointments = {}
```

## 2. Loading your Knowledge Base

With everything setup, let's start by building our **RAG engine**, which will be responsible for facilitating all our patient diagnoses. The first step is to load the relevant medical information chunks from our knowledge base into the system. We'll use the `SimpleDirectoryReader` from `llama-index` to accomplish this.

```python
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader

class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_directory):
        self.appointments = {}
        self.load_data(data_directory)

    def load_data(self, data_directory):
        # Load documents from a directory
        self.documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(data_directory).load_data()
```

## 3. Embeding and Storage

Next, we'll use LlamaIndex's `VectorStoreIndex` to embed our chunks and store them in a `chromadb` database. This step is absolutely crucial because our encyclopedia spans over 4,000 pages of dense medical information. By embedding the data and storing it in a vector database, we can ensure fast and accurate retrieval, even with such a vast knowledge base.

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.chroma import ChromaVectorStore

class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_directory, db_path):
        self.appointments = {}
        self.load_data(data_directory)
        self.store_data(db_path)

    def load_data(self, data_directory):
        ...

    def store_data(self, db_path):
        # Set up the database and store vectorized data
        db = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=db_path)
        chroma_collection = db.get_or_create_collection("medical_knowledge")
        vector_store = ChromaVectorStore(chroma_collection=chroma_collection)
        storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)
        self.index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(self.documents, storage_context=storage_context)
```

## 4. Assembling your RAG Engine

With our knowledge base chunked, embedded, and stored, we can now assemble our RAG engine. In `llama-index`, a RAG engine can be abstracted as a `QueryEngineTool`. This is especially useful for building agentic applications like this one, where you'll also define additional tools beyond RAG.

```python
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool

class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_directory, db_path):
        self.appointments = {}
        self.load_data(data_directory)
        self.store_data(db_path)
        self.setup_tools()
    ...

    def setup_tools(self):
        query_engine = self.index.as_query_engine()
        self.medical_diagnosis_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
            query_engine,
            name="medical_diagnosis",
            description="A RAG engine for retrieving medical information."
        )
```

## 5. Creating Function-calling Tools

This section focuses on **defining the remaining tools** needed to interact with the medical appointment system. Each of these tools is a callable function that the agent can use, enabling functionalities such as creating, updating, and confirming appointments. LLamaIndex's `FunctionTool` feature allows us to build these functional tools by simply wrapping the class around the function.

```python
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool

class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_directory, db_path):
        self.appointments = {}
        self.load_data(data_directory)
        self.store_data(db_path)
        self.setup_tools()
    ...

    def setup_tools(self):
        # Configure function tools for the system
        self.get_appointment_state_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=self.get_appointment_state)
        self.update_appointment_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=self.update_appointment)
        self.create_appointment_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=self.create_appointment)
        self.record_diagnosis_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=self.record_diagnosis)
        self.confirm_appointment_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=self.confirm_appointment, return_direct=True)
        self.medical_diagnosis_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(
            self.query_engine,
            name="medical_diagnosis",
            description="A RAG engine for retrieving medical information."
        )
```

**Key Tools:**

- `get_appointment_state_tool`: Retrieves the state of a specific appointment.
- `update_appointment_tool`: Updates a property of an appointment.
- `create_appointment_tool`: Creates a new appointment.
- `record_diagnosis_tool`: Records a diagnosis for an appointment.
- `confirm_appointment_tool`: Confirms the details of an appointment.

:::info
For the purposes of this tutorial, you won’t need to define custom logic for agentic reasoning. As you'll see later, LlamaIndex's `FunctionCallingAgent` can effectively utilize these tools.
:::

### 1. Retrieving Appointments

Retrieves the current state of an appointment based on its ID.

```python
def get_appointment_state(self, appointment_id: str) -> str:
    try:
        return str(self.appointments[appointment_id].dict())
    except KeyError:
        return f"Appointment ID {appointment_id} not found"
```

**Description:**

- Returns the serialized details of the specified appointment.
- If the appointment ID is invalid, it provides an error message.

### 2. Updating Appointments

Updates a specific property of an appointment.

```python
def update_appointment(self, appointment_id: str, property: str, value: str) -> str:
    appointment = self.appointments.get(appointment_id)
    if appointment:
        setattr(appointment, property, value)
        return f"Appointment ID {appointment_id} updated with {property} = {value}"
    return "Appointment not found"
```

**Description:**

- Modifies a property (e.g., symptoms, date) of an existing appointment.
- Returns a success or failure message.

### 3. Creating Appointments

Creates a new appointment with a unique ID.

```python
def create_appointment(self, appointment_id: str) -> str:
    self.appointments[appointment_id] = MedicalAppointment()
    return "Appointment created."
```

**Description:**

- Initializes a new appointment object and stores it in the system.
- Returns a success message.

### 4. Recording Appointments

Records a diagnosis for an appointment after symptoms have been noted.

```python
def record_diagnosis(self, appointment_id: str, diagnosis: str) -> str:
    appointment: MedicalAppointment = self.appointments.get(appointment_id)
    if appointment and appointment.symptoms:
        appointment.diagnosis = diagnosis
        return f"Diagnosis recorded for Appointment ID {appointment_id}. Diagnosis: {diagnosis}"
    return "Diagnosis cannot be recorded. Please tell me more about your symptoms."
```

**Description:**

- Adds a diagnosis to an appointment if symptoms have already been recorded.
- Prompts the user to provide symptoms if they are missing.

### 5. Confirming Appointments

Confirms the details of an appointment.

```python
def confirm_appointment(self, appointment_id: str):
    appointment: MedicalAppointment = self.appointments.get(appointment_id)
    if appointment:
        details = f"Name: {appointment.name}, Email: {appointment.email}, Date: {appointment.date}, Symptoms: {appointment.symptoms}, Diagnosis: {appointment.diagnosis}"
        confirmation_prompt = f"Please confirm the following details: {details}. Type 'confirm' to finalize or 'edit' to modify."
        print(confirmation_prompt)
        user_input = input("Enter your response: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'confirm':
            return "Details confirmed and saved."
        elif user_input.lower() == 'edit':
            return "Please specify what you would like to edit."
        else:
            return "Invalid input. No changes were made."
    return "Appointment not found."
```

**Description:**

- Presents appointment details to the user for confirmation.
- Handles user input to confirm or edit the details.
- Ensures no changes are made if the input is invalid.

## 6. Assembling the Agent

Now that we have set up our tools and data systems, the next step is to finally assemble our agent. We'll utilize the `FunctionCallingAgent` from LlamaIndex to manage interactions between the user and our tools effectively. This agent will dynamically choose the appropriate tool based on the user's input and the context of the conversation. Additionally, we define the LLM (gpt-4o), system prompt, as well as the maximum number of function calls.

```python
from llama_index.core.agent import FunctionCallingAgent
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    ...
    def setup_agent(self):
        # Initialize the GPT model and define the agent
        gpt = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.1)
        self.agent = FunctionCallingAgent.from_tools(
            tools=[
                self.get_appointment_state_tool,
                self.update_appointment_tool,
                self.create_appointment_tool,
                self.record_diagnosis_tool,
                self.medical_diagnosis_tool,
                self.confirm_appointment_tool
            ],
            llm=gpt,
            prefix_messages=[
                ChatMessage(
                    role="system",
                    content=(
                        "You are an expert in medical diagnosis and are now connected to the patient booking system. "
                        "The first step is to create the appointment and record the symptoms. Ask for specific symptoms! "
                        "Then after the symptoms have been created, make a diagnosis. Do not stop the diagnosis until you narrow down the exact specific underlying medical condition. "
                        "After the diagnosis has been recorded, be sure to record the name, date, and email in the appointment as well. Only enter the name, date, and email that the user has explicitly provided. "
                        "Update the symptoms and diagnosis in the appointment."
                        "Once all information has been recorded, confirm the appointment."
                    ),
                )
            ],
            max_function_calls=10,
            allow_parallel_tool_calls=False
        )
```

## 7. Setting up the Interactive Session

The final step involves setting up the interaction environment where users can engage with our medical chatbot. This includes configuring the input and output settings, initiating the chat session, and managing conversation flow.

```python
class MedicalAppointmentSystem:
    ...
    def interactive_session(self):
        print("Welcome to the Medical Diagnosis and Booking System!")
        print("Please enter your symptoms or ask about appointment details.")

        while True:
            user_input = input("Your query: ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
                break

            response = self.agent.chat(user_input)
            print("Agent Response:", response.response)
```

Run the code below to begin testing your medical chatbot:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    system = MedicalAppointmentSystem(data_directory="./data", db_path="./chroma_db")
    system.interactive_session()
```

Here's a full conversational thread between a hypothetical user and the `MedicalAppointmentSystem`:

```
User: I'm feeling a bit sick today. I've been coughing a lot lately!

############

System Response: I can help you with that. Let's start by creating an appointment and recording your symptoms.
Could you please provide more specific details about your symptoms? For example, do you have a fever, sore
throat, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms along with the cough?

############

User: I had a fever a few days ago. Right now, I'm just coughing non-stop. I don't have shortness of breath,
although my throat feels dry and itchy all the time.

############

System Response: Based on the symptoms you've described, it seems like you might have a respiratory infection,
such as acute bronchitis or a viral upper respiratory infection. Let's narrow it down further.

- **Acute Bronchitis**: Often follows a cold or other respiratory infection and is characterized by a
persistent cough, which may produce mucus, and a dry, itchy throat.
- **Viral Upper Respiratory Infection**: Commonly known as the common cold, it can cause a cough, fever, and
throat irritation.

Given that you had a fever a few days ago and are now experiencing a persistent cough with a dry and itchy
throat, it is more likely to be acute bronchitis.

I'll record this diagnosis for your appointment. Could you please provide your name, date, and email for the appointment?

############

User: Luke, luke@gmail.com, 12 December 2025

############

System Response: Please confirm the following details: Name: Luke, Email: luke@gmail.com, Date: 12 December 2025,
Symptoms: Coughing non-stop, fever a few days ago, dry and itchy throat., Diagnosis: Acute Bronchitis.
Type 'confirm' to finalize or 'edit' to modify.
```
