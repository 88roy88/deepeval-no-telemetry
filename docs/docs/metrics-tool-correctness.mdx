import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The **tool correctness metric** evaluates your agent's tool-calling abilities by comparing the `tools_used` by your LLM agent to the `expected_tools`. A perfect score of 1 indicates that all tools called by your LLM agent can be found in the list of expected tools, and a score of 0 indicates that none of the tools that were called were expected to be called.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ToolCorrectnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `tools_used`
- `expected_tools`

:::note
The `ToolCorrectnessMetric` is an agent metric designed to evaluate LLM Agents and LLM apps utilizing tool-calling agents.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import ContextualRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = ContextualRelevancyMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
    tools_used=["WebSearch"]
    expected_tools=["WebSearch", "ToolQuery"]
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are four optional parameters when creating a `ContextualRelevancyMetricMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The **tool correctness metric** score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation
  formula="\text{Tool Correctness} = \frac{\text{Number of Correctly Used Tools}}{\text{Total Number of Tools Used}}
"
/>

This metric assesses the accuracy of your agent's tool usage by comparing the `tools_used` by your LLM agent to the `expected_tools`. A score of 1 indicates that every tool utilized by your LLM agent matches the expected tools, while a score of 0 signifies that none of the used tools were among the expected tools.
