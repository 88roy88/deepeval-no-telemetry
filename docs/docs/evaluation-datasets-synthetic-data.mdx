## Quick Summary

`deepeval` offers a data `Synthesizer` for anyone to easily generate evaluation datasets from scratch. The `Synthesizer` class is a synthetic data generator that first uses an LLM to generate a series of `input`s, before evolving each `input` to make them more complex and realistic. These evolved inputs are then used to create a **list of synthetic `Golden`s**, which makes up your synthetic `EvaluationDataset`.

:::tip Did You Know?
`deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` uses the data evolution method to generate large volumes of data across various complexity levels to make synthetic data more realistic. This method was originally introduced by the developers of Eval-Struct and WizardML. For further details, [read the original paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244).
:::

## Creating An Synthesizer

`deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` can be used as a standalone or within an `EvaluationDataset`. To begin, create a `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
```

There are two optional parameters when creating a `Synthesizer`:

- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4-0125-preview'.
- [Optional] `multithreading`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables **concurrent generation of goldens**. Defaulted to `True`.

## Using Synthesizer as a Standalone

There are 2 approaches a `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` can generate synthetic `Golden`s:

1. Generating synthetic `Golden`s using **context extracted from documents.**
2. Generating synthetic `Golden`s from a **list of provided context.**

### Generating From Documents

To generate synthetic `Golden`s from documents, simply provide a list of document paths:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf'],
    max_goldens_per_document=2
)
```

There are one mandatory and six optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs` method:

- `document_paths`: a list strings, representing the path to the documents from which contexts will be extracted from. Supported documents types include: `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf`.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_document`: the maximum number of golden data points to be generated for each document. Defaulted to 5.
- [Optional] `chunk_size`: specifies the size of text chunks (in characters) to be considered for context extraction within each document. Defaulted to 1024.
- [Optional] `chunk_overlap`: an int that determines the overlap size between consecutive text chunks during context extraction. Defaulted to 0.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the **complexity and diversity** of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `enable_breadth_evolve`: a boolean which when set to `True`, introduces a **wider variety of context modifications**, enhancing the dataset's diversity. Defaulted to `False`.

:::info
The `generate_goldens_from_docs` method employs a token-based text splitter to manage document chunking, meaning the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters do not guarantee exact context sizes. This approach is designed to ensure **meaningful and coherent context extraction**, but might lead to variations in the expected size of each `context`.
:::

### Generating From Provided Contexts

`deepeval` also allows you to generate synthetic `Goldens` from a manually provided a list of context instead of directly generating from your documents.

:::note
This is especially helpful if you already have an indexed and/or embedded knowledge base. For example, if you already have documents parsed and stored in an existing vector database, you may consider handling the logic to retrieve text chunks yourself.
:::

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens(
    # Provide a list of context for synthetic data generation
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

There are one mandatory and four optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens` method:

- `contexts`: a list of context, where each context is itself a list of strings, ideally sharing a common theme or subject area.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_context`: the maximum number of golden data points to be generated from each context. Adjusting this parameter can influence the size of the resulting dataset. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the **complexity and diversity** of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `enable_breadth_evolve`: a boolean indicating whether to enable breadth evolution strategies during data generation. When set to True, it introduces a **wider variety of context modifications**, enhancing the dataset's diversity. Defaulted to `False`.

:::caution
You can also optionally generate `expected_output`s alongside each golden, but you should always aim to cross-check any generated expected output.
:::

### Saving Generated Goldens

To not accidentally lose any generated synthetic `Golden`, you can use the `save_as()` method:

```python
synthesizer.save_as(
    file_type='json', # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

## Using Synthesizer Within An Evaluation Dataset

An `EvaluationDataset` also has the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods, which under the hood is powered by the `Synthesizer`'s implementation.

:::info
Except for an additional option to accept a custom `Synthesizer` as argument, the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods in an `EvaluationDataset` accepts the exact same arguments as those on a `Synthesizer`.
:::

You can optionally specify a custom `Synthesizer` when calling `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` through the `EvaluationDataset` interface if for example, you wish to use a custom LLM to generate synthetic data. If no `Synthesizer` is provided, the default `Synthesizer` configuration is used.

To begin, optionally create custom `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

Then, provide it as an argument to `generate_goldens_from_docs`:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
...

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    document_paths=['example.pdf'],
)
```

Or, to `generate_goldens`:

```python
...

dataset.generate_goldens(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

Lastly, don't forget to call `save_as()` to perserve any generated synthetic `Golden`:

```python
saved_path = dataset.save_as(
    file_type='json',  # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

:::tip
The `save_as()` method returns a string to the path the dataset was saved to, just in case you need to use it in code later on.
