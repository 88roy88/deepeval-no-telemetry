## Quick Summary

DeepEval's `Synthesizer` offers a **fast and easy to automatically get started with testing** your LLM by generating high-quality evaluation datasets (inputs, expected outputs, and contexts) from scratch.

The `Synthesizer` class is a synthetic data generator that first uses an LLM to generate a series of `input`s, before evolving each `input` to make them more complex and realistic. These evolved inputs are then used to create a list of synthetic `Golden`s, which makes up your synthetic `EvaluationDataset`.

:::tip Did You Know?
`deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` uses the data evolution method to generate large volumes of data across various complexity levels to make synthetic data more realistic. This method was originally introduced by the developers of [Evol-Instruct and WizardML.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244)

For those interested, here is a [great article on how `deepeval`'s synthesizer was built.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)
:::

## Creating An Synthesizer

`deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` can be used as a standalone or within an `EvaluationDataset`. To begin, create a `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
```

There are two optional parameters when creating a `Synthesizer`:

- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to `gpt-4o`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables **concurrent generation of goldens**. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `embedder`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's embedding models to use, **OR** [any custom embedding model](#using-a-custom-embedding-model) of type `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel`. Defaulted to 'text-embedding-3-small'.

:::info
As you'll learn later, an embedding model is only used when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs()` method, so don't worry about the `embedder` parameter too much unless you're looking to use your own embedding model.
:::

## Using Synthesizer As A Standalone

There are 3 approaches a `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` can generate synthetic `Golden`s:

1. Generating synthetic `Golden`s using **context extracted from documents.**
2. Generating synthetic `Golden`s from a **list of provided context.**
3. Generating synthetic `Golden`s from **scratch**

### 1. Generating From Documents

To generate synthetic `Golden`s from documents, simply provide a list of document paths:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf'],
    max_goldens_per_document=2
)
```

There are one mandatory and seven optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs` method:

- `document_paths`: a list strings, representing the path to the documents from which contexts will be extracted from. Supported documents types include: `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf`.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_document`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per document. Defaulted to 5.
- [Optional] `chunk_size`: specifies the size of text chunks (in characters) to be considered for context extraction within each document. Defaulted to 1024.
- [Optional] `chunk_overlap`: an int that determines the overlap size between consecutive text chunks during context extraction. Defaulted to 0.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the **complexity and diversity** of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `Evolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s with equal percentage.

:::info
`Evolution` is an `ENUM` that specifies the different data evolution techniques you wish to employee to make synthetic `Golden`s more realistic.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Evolution

available_evolutions = {
    Evolution.REASONING: 1/7,
    Evolution.MULTICONTEXT: 1/7,
    Evolution.CONCRETIZING: 1/7,
    Evolution.CONSTRAINED: 1/7,
    Evolution.COMPARATIVE: 1/7,
    Evolution.HYPOTHETICAL: 1/7,
    Evolution.IN_BREADTH: 1/7,
}
```

For those interested in what these evolutions mean, you can [read this article here.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)
:::

The `generate_goldens_from_docs` method employs a token-based text splitter to manage document chunking, meaning the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters do not guarantee exact context sizes. This approach is designed to ensure **meaningful and coherent context extraction**, but might lead to variations in the expected size of each `context`.

:::caution
The synthesizer will raise an error if `chunk_size` is too large for `max_goldens_per_document`, and suggest **the appropriate number of chunks** to use.
:::

### 2. Generating From Provided Contexts

`deepeval` also allows you to generate synthetic `Goldens` from a manually provided a list of context instead of directly generating from your documents.

:::tip
This is especially helpful if you already have an embedded knowledge base. For example, if you already have documents parsed and stored in an existing vector database, you may consider handling the logic to retrieve text chunks yourself.
:::

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens(
    # Provide a list of context for synthetic data generation
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

There are one mandatory and five optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens` method:

- `contexts`: a list of context, where each context is itself a list of strings, ideally sharing a common theme or subject area.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_context`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per context. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the **complexity and diversity** of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `Evolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s with equal percentage.

:::caution
While the previous methods first use an LLM to generate a series of inputs based on the provided context before evolving them, `generate_goldens_from_inputs` simply evolves the provided list of inputs into more complex and diverse `Golden`s. It's also important to note that this method will only populate the input field of each generated `Golden`.
:::

### 3. Generating From Scratch

If you do not have a list of example prompts, or wish to solely rely on an LLM generation for synthesis, you can also generate synthetic `Golden`s simply by specifying the subject, task, and output format you wish your prompts to follow.

:::tip
Generating goldens from scratch is especially helpful when you wish to **evaluate your LLM on a specific task**, such as red-teaming or text-to-SQL use cases!
:::

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_scratch(
    subject="Harmful and toxic prompts, with emphasis on dark humor",
    task="Red-team LLMs",
    output_format="string",
    num_initial_goldens=25,
    num_evolutions=20
)
```

This method is a **2-step function** that first generates a list of prompts about a given subject for a certain task and in a certain output format, before using the generated list of prompts to generate more prompts through data evolution.

:::info
The subject, task, and output format parameters are all strings that are inserted into a predefined prompt template, meaning these parameters are **flexible and will need to be iterated on** for optimal results.
:::

There are four mandatory and three optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs` method:

- `subject`: a string, specifying the subject and nature of your generated `Golden`s
- `task`: a string, representing the purpose of these evaluation `Golden`s
- `output_format`: a string, representing the expected output format. This is not equivalent to python `type`s but simply gives you more control over the structure of your synthetic data.
- `num_initial_goldens`: the number of goldens generated before consequent evolutions
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated prompt. This parameter controls the **complexity and diversity** of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `PropmtEvolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s with equal percentage.
  The subject, task, and output format parameters are all strings that are inserted into a predefined prompt template, meaning these parameters are **flexible and will need to be iterated on** for optimal results.

:::info
`PromptEvolution` is an `ENUM` that specifies the different data evolution techniques you wish to employee to make synthetic contextless `Golden`s more realistic.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import PromptEvolution

available_evolutions = {
    PromptEvolution.REASONING: 1/6,
    PromptEvolution.CONCRETIZING: 1/6,
    PromptEvolution.CONSTRAINED: 1/6,
    PromptEvolution.COMPARATIVE: 1/6,
    PromptEvolution.HYPOTHETICAL: 1/6,
    PromptEvolution.IN_BREADTH: 1/6
}
```

For those interested in what these evolutions mean, you can [read this article here.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)
:::

## Convert to DataFrame

To convert your synthetically generated goldens into a DataFrame, simply call the `to_pandas` method on the synthesizer object:

```python
dataframe = synthesizer.to_pandas()
print(dataframe)
```

### Sample Dataframe

Here’s an example of what the resulting DataFrame might look like:

| Input                                          | Actual Output | Expected Output | Context                                                               | Retrieval Context | Chunks per Context | Context Length | Attack Type | Evolutions | Source File |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Who wrote the novel "1984"?                    | None          | George Orwell   | ["1984 is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by George Orwell."]     | None              | 1                  | 60             | None        | None       | file1.txt   |
| What is the boiling point of water in Celsius? | None          | 100°C           | ["Water boils at 100°C (212°F) under standard atmospheric pressure."] | None              | 1                  | 55             | None        | None       | file2.txt   |
| ...                                            | ...           | ...             | ...                                                                   | ...               | ...                | ...            | ...         | ...        | ...         |

## Saving Generated Goldens

To not accidentally lose any generated synthetic `Golden`, you can use the `save_as()` method:

```python
synthesizer.save_as(
    file_type='json', # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

## Using Synthesizer Within An Evaluation Dataset

An `EvaluationDataset` also has the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods, which under the hood is powered by the `Synthesizer`'s implementation.

:::info
Except for an additional option to accept a custom `Synthesizer` as argument, the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods in an `EvaluationDataset` accepts the exact same arguments as those on a `Synthesizer`.
:::

You can optionally specify a custom `Synthesizer` when calling `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` through the `EvaluationDataset` interface if for example, you wish to use a custom LLM to generate synthetic data. If no `Synthesizer` is provided, the default `Synthesizer` configuration is used.

To begin, optionally create a custom `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

Then, provide it as an argument to `generate_goldens_from_docs`:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
...

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    document_paths=['example.pdf'],
)
```

Or, to `generate_goldens`:

```python
...

dataset.generate_goldens(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

Or, to `generate_red_teaming_goldens`:

```python
...

dataset.generate_red_teaming_goldens(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

Lastly, don't forget to call `save_as()` to perserve any generated synthetic `Golden`:

```python
saved_path = dataset.save_as(
    file_type='json',  # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

:::tip
The `save_as()` method returns a string to the path the dataset was saved to, just in case you need to use it in code later on.
:::

## Using a Custom Embedding Model

:::info
Under the hood, only the `generate_goldens_from_docs()` method uses an embedding model. This is because in order to generate goldens from documents, the `Synthesizer` uses cosine similarity to generate the relevant context needed for data synthesization.
:::

### Using Azure OpenAI

You can use Azure's OpenAI embedding models by running the following commands in the CLI:

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai --openai-endpoint=<endpoint> \
    --openai-api-key=<api_key> \
    --deployment-name=<deployment_name> \
    --openai-api-version=<openai_api_version> \
    --model-version=<model_version>
```

Then, run this to set the Azure OpenAI embedder:

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai-embedding --embedding_deployment-name=<embedding_deployment_name>
```

:::tip Did You Know?
The first command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI LLM globally, while the second command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI's embedding models globally.
:::

## Using local LLM models

There are several local LLM providers that offer an OpenAI API compatible endpoint, like Ollama or LM Studio. You can use them with `deepeval` by setting several parameters from the CLI. To configure any of those providers, you need to supply the base URL where the service is running. These are some of the most popular alternatives for base URLs:

- Ollama: http://localhost:11434/v1/
- LM Studio: http://localhost:1234/v1/

For example to use a local model served by Ollama, use the following command:

```console
deepeval set-local-model --model-name=<model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:11434/v1/" \
    --api-key="ollama"
```

Where model_name is one of the LLM that appears when executing `ollama list`.

If you ever wish to stop using your local LLM model and move back to regular OpenAI, simply run:

```console
deepeval unset-local-model
```

Then, run this to set the local Embeddings model:

```console
deepeval set-local-embeddings --model-name=<embedding_model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:11434/v1/" \
    --api-key="ollama"
```

To revert back to the default OpenAI embeddings run:

```console
deepeval unset-local-embeddings
```

For additional instructions about LLM model and embeddings model availability and base URLs, consult the provider's documentation.

### Using Any Custom Model

Alternatively, you can also create a custom embedding model in code by inheriting the base `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel` class. Here is an example of using the same custom Azure OpenAI embedding model but created in code instead using langchain's `langchain_openai` module:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbeddings
from deepeval.models import DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel

class CustomEmbeddingModel(DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def load_model(self):
        return AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
            openai_api_version="...",
            azure_deployment="...",
            azure_endpoint="...",
            openai_api_key="...",
        )

    def embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return embedding_model.embed_query(text)

    def embed_texts(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return embedding_model.embed_documents(texts)

    async def a_embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return await embedding_model.aembed_query(text)

    async def a_embed_texts(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return await embedding_model.aembed_documents(texts)

    def get_model_name(self):
        "Custom Azure Embedding Model"
```

When creating a custom embedding model, you should **ALWAYS**:

- inherit `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel`.
- implement the `get_model_name()` method, which simply returns a string representing your custom model name.
- implement the `load_model()` method, which will be responsible for returning the model object instance.
- implement the `embed_text()` method with **one and only one** parameter of type `str` as the text to be embedded, and returns a vector of type `List[float]`. We called `embedding_model.embed_query(prompt)` to access the embedded text in this particular example, but this could be different depending on the implementation of your custom model object.
- implement the `embed_texts()` method with **one and only one** parameter of type `List[str]` as the list of strings text to be embedded, and return a list of vectors of type `List[List[float]]`.
- implement the asynchronous `a_embed_text()` and `a_embed_texts()` method, with the same function signature as their respective synchronous versions. Since this is an asynchronous method, remember to use `async/await`.

:::note
If an asynchronous version of your embedding model does not exist, simply reuse the synchronous implementation:

```python
class CustomEmbeddingModel(DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel):
    ...
    async def a_embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        return self.embed_text(text)
```

:::

Lastly, provide the custom embedding model through the `embedder` parameter when creating a `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer
...

synthesizer = Synthesizer(embedder=CustomEmbeddingModel())
```

:::tip
If you run into **invalid JSON errors** using custom models, you may want to consult [this guide](guides-using-custom-llms) on using custom LLMs for evaluation, as synthetic data generation also supports pydantic confinement for custom models.
