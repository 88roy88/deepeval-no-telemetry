## Quick Summary

DeepEval's `Synthesizer` offers a **fast and easy to automatically get started with testing** your LLM by generating high-quality evaluation datasets (inputs, expected outputs, and contexts) from scratch.

The `Synthesizer` class is a synthetic data generator that first uses an LLM to generate a series of `input`s, before evolving each `input` to make them more complex and realistic. These evolved inputs are then used to create a list of synthetic `Golden`s, which makes up your synthetic `EvaluationDataset`.

:::info Did You Know?
`deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` uses the data evolution method to generate large volumes of data across various complexity levels to make synthetic data more realistic. This method was originally introduced by the developers of [Evol-Instruct and WizardML.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244)

For those interested, here is a [great article on how `deepeval`'s synthesizer was built.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)
:::

## Synthesizer Methods Overview

There are 3 approaches a `deepeval`'s `Synthesizer` can generate synthetic `Golden`s:

1. Generating synthetic `Golden`s using **context extracted from documents.**
2. Generating synthetic `Golden`s from a **list of provided context.**
3. Generating synthetic `Golden`s from **scratch**

### 1. Generating `Golden`s from documents

If your application is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, generating Goldens from documents can be particularly useful, especially if you already have access to the **documents that make up your knowledge base**. By simply providing these documents, the Synthesizer will automatically handle generating the relevant contexts needed for synthesizing test Goldens.

To generate contexts from user-provided documents, the documents are first split into chunks and embedded to form a collection of nodes. Random nodes are then selected, and for each selected node, similar nodes are retrieved and grouped together to create contexts. These contexts are then used to generate synthetic inputs and outputs, which are evolved to form your Golden test dataset.

      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

:::tip
When generating contexts from document chunks, you'll need to consider parameters such as `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`, as well as which embedding models to use, and how you'll want to qualify the selected chunks. For more details, see this guide: [Using the Synthesizer](guides-using-synthesizer).
:::

### 2. Generating `Golden`s from contexts

If you already have access to prepared contexts, you can skip the document processing step entirely. Instead, simply provide these contexts to the Synthesizer, and it will handle generating the Goldens directly without the need to process documents.

  style={{
    display: "flex",

      marginBottom: "20px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

### 3. Generating `Golden`s from scratch

You can also generate synthetic Goldens from scratch, without needing any documents or contexts. Simply provide the task (the goal of your application), the scenario (the environment or context in which a user interacts), and the desired input format (e.g. web search, text-to-SQL query, conversation). This way, you can customize the Goldens to reflect exactly **how you want users to interact with your system**.

:::info
This approach is particularly useful if your LLM application **doesn’t rely on RAG** or if you want to **test your LLM on queries beyond the existing knowledge base**.
:::

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/generate_from_scratch.svg"
    alt="LangChain"
    style={{
      marginTop: "50px",
      marginBottom: "50px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

Imagine you want to test how well your LLM chatbot can handle text-to-SQL requests. A great place to start is by generating examples from scratch. In this case, you'd want to generate Goldens where the inputs are natural language questions that need to be converted into SQL queries using the following parameters:

- `task`: answering text-to-SQL queries by accessing a database and returning the results
- `scenario`: non-technical users trying to query the database using plain English
- `input_format`: plain english text-to-SQL queries

:::note
Note that you can also specify the scenario, task, input format, and expected output format **when generating from documents or contexts**. However, unlike those methods, you **won’t be able to generate the expected output** when starting from scratch, as there is no context to serve as the ground truth reference.
:::

## Creating a Synthesizer

DeepEval's synthesizer can be used as a standalone or within an `EvaluationDataset`. To start generating Goldens using the synthesizer as a standalone, begin by creating a `Synthesizer` object:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
```

There are nine optional parameters when creating a `Synthesizer`:

- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables **concurrent generation of goldens**. Defaulted to `True`.

### Model Parameters

These parameters allow you to specify which model to use for generating synthetic inputs from contexts and evolving them (`model`), which model to use for filtering during context generation and synthetic input generation (`critic_model`), and which model to use for transforming your document chunks (`embedder`).

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

class CustomSynthesizerModel(DeepEvalBaseLLM):
...

synthesizer = Synthesizer(
    model=CustomSynthesizerModel(),
    critic_model="gpt-4o",
    embedder="text-embedding-ada-002",
)
```

- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to `gpt-4o`.
- [Optional] `critic_model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use for quality filtering, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to `gpt-4o`.
- [Optional] `embedder`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's embedding models to use, **OR** [any custom embedding model](#using-a-custom-embedding-model) of type `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel`. Defaulted to 'text-embedding-3-small'.

:::info
As you'll learn later, an embedding model is only used when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs()` method, so don't worry about the `embedder` parameter too much unless you're looking to use your own embedding model.
:::

### Filtering Parameters

These parameters allow you to control the quality of both context generation and synthetic input generation by configuring quality thresholds and max retry settings.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer(
    context_quality_threshold=0.6,
    context_similarity_threshold=0.7,
    context_max_retries=4,
    synthetic_input_quality_threshold=0.8,
    synthetic_input_max_retries=5,
)
```

#### Context Filtering:

:::note
Context filtering is only applicable when using the `generate_from_docs` method.
:::

- [Optional] `context_quality_threshold`: a float representing the minimum quality threshold for context selection. If the context quality is lower than this threshold, the context will be rejected. Defaulted to `0.5`.
- [Optional] `context_similarity_threshold`: a float representing the minimum similarity score required for context matching (via cosine similarity). Contexts with similarity scores lower than this threshold will not be used. Defaulted to `0.5`.
- [Optional] `context_max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry context generation if it does not meet the required quality or similarity threshold. Defaulted to `3`.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "start",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/filtering_context.svg"
    alt="LangChain"
    style={{
      marginTop: "50px",
      marginBottom: "50px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />
</div>

#### Synthetic Input Filtering:

- [Optional] `synthetic_input_quality_threshold`: a float representing the minimum quality threshold for synthetic input generation. Inputs with lower quality will be rejected. Defaulted to `0.5`.
- [Optional] `synthetic_input_max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry synthetic input generation if it does not meet the required quality. Defaulted to `3`.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "start",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/filtering_input.svg"
    alt="LangChain"
    style={{
      marginTop: "50px",
      marginBottom: "50px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
  />

</div>

It's important to note that if the quality scores for both the input and context do not meet the required thresholds after the allowed maximum retries, the most recent generation will be used. As a result, you may find generated Goldens that do not meet the minimum thresholds in your final evaluation dataset.

:::info
To learn more about how scores for **context quality** and **input quality** are generated, [see this guide](#guides-using-synthesizer).
:::

## Generating Goldens

Once you've created a `Synthesizer` object with the desired filtering parameters and models, you can begin generating Goldens.

### 1. Generating From Documents

:::note
You must install `chromadb` v0.5.3 as an additional dependency when generating from documents. The use of a vector database allows for for faster indexing and retrieval of chunks during generation.

```python
pip install chromadb==0.5.3
```

:::
To generate synthetic `Golden`s from documents, simply provide a list of document paths:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf'],
)
```

There are one mandatory and eleven optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs` method:

- `document_paths`: a list strings, representing the path to the documents from which contexts will be extracted from. Supported documents types include: `.txt`, `.docx`, and `.pdf`.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_context`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per context. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `max_contexts_per_document`: the maximum number of contexts to be generated per document. Defaulted to 3.
- [Optional] `chunk_size`: specifies the size of text chunks (in characters) to be considered for context extraction within each document. Defaulted to 1024.
- [Optional] `chunk_overlap`: an int that determines the overlap size between consecutive text chunks during context extraction. Defaulted to 0.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the complexity and diversity of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `Evolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s with equal probability.
- [Optional] `scenario`: a string, specifying the context or setting in which the inputs are fed into the target LLM.
- [Optional] `task`: a string, representing task or purpose of the target LLM.
- [Optional] `input_format`: a string, representing the ideal structure and format of the inputs to be generated.
- [Optional] `expected_output_format`: a string, representing the ideal structure and format of the expected outputs to be generated.

#### Context Generation:

A **token-based text splitter** is used to manage document chunking, meaning the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters do not guarantee exact context sizes. This approach ensures contexts are meaningful and coherent, but might lead to variations in the expected size of each `context`.

:::caution
The synthesizer will raise an error if `chunk_size` is too large to generate n=`max_contexts_per_document` unique contexts.
:::

#### Evolutions:

`Evolution` is an `ENUM` that specifies the different data evolution techniques you wish to employee to make synthetic `Golden`s more realistic. DeepEval's synthesizer supports 7 types of evolutions, which are randomly sampled based on a defined distribution. You can apply multiple evolutions to each Golden, and later access the evolution sequence through the Golden's additional metadata field.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Evolution

available_evolutions = {
    Evolution.REASONING: 1/7,
    Evolution.MULTICONTEXT: 1/7,
    Evolution.CONCRETIZING: 1/7,
    Evolution.CONSTRAINED: 1/7,
    Evolution.COMPARATIVE: 1/7,
    Evolution.HYPOTHETICAL: 1/7,
    Evolution.IN_BREADTH: 1/7,
}
```

For example, a Golden might take the following evolution route when `num_evolutions` is set to 2 and `evolutions` is a dictionary containing `Evolution.IN_BREADTH`, `Evolution.COMPARATIVE`, and `Evolution.REASONING`, with sampling probabilities of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively:

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}

  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/evolutions.svg"
    alt="LangChain"
    style={{
      marginTop: "20px",
      marginBottom: "50px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "400px",
    }}
  />

</div>

:::info
For those interested in what these evolutions mean, you can [read this article here.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-synthetic-data-generation-using-llms)
:::

#### Prompt Customization:

You can also customize the input and expected output for each golden by configuring the scenario, task, and input format parameters, which control the synthetic input, while the expected_output format controls the synthetic expected output.

For example, the following example demonstrates how to use the `Synthesizer` to generate synthetic Goldens for a **text-to-SQL** use case by leveraging the table schema from the context:

```python
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    document_paths=['example.txt', 'example.docx', 'example.pdf'],
    scenario="Non-technical users trying to query a database using plain English instructions",
    task="Answering text-to-SQL-related queries by querying a database and returning the results to users",
    input_format="English instructions for retrieving information from a database",
    expected_output_format="SQL query based on the given input"
)
```

The scenario, task, and input format parameters are used to enforce the input structure during generation and after all the evolutions have been performed. The output is then generated from the final evolved input, with the output format enforced.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "start",
  }}
>
  <img
    src="https://confident-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/synthesizer_customization.svg"
    alt="LangChain"
    style={{
      marginTop: "50px",
      marginBottom: "50px",
      height: "auto",
      maxHeight: "800px",
    }}
/>

</div>

### 2. Generating From Provided Contexts

`deepeval` also allows you to generate synthetic `Goldens` from a manually provided a list of context instead of directly generating from your documents.

:::tip
This is especially helpful if you **already have an embedded knowledge base**. For example, if you already have documents parsed and stored in an existing vector database, you may consider handling the logic to retrieve text chunks yourself.
:::

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens(
    # Provide a list of context for synthetic data generation
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

There are one mandatory and seven optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens` method:

- `contexts`: a list of context, where each context is itself a list of strings, ideally sharing a common theme or subject area.
- [Optional] `include_expected_output`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will additionally generate an `expected_output` for each synthetic `Golden`. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `max_goldens_per_context`: the maximum number of goldens to be generated per context. Defaulted to 2.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated input. This parameter controls the complexity and diversity of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `Evolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s with equal probability.
- [Optional] `scenario`: a string, specifying the context or setting in which the inputs are fed into the target LLM.
- [Optional] `task`: a string, representing task or purpose of the target LLM.
- [Optional] `input_format`: a string, representing the ideal structure and format of the inputs to be generated.
- [Optional] `expected_output_format`: a string, representing the ideal structure and format of the expected outputs to be generated.

### 3. Generating From Scratch

If you do not have a list of example prompts, or wish to solely rely on an LLM generation for synthesis, you can also generate synthetic `Golden`s simply by specifying the scenario, task, and input format you wish your synthetic inputs to follow.

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer()
synthesizer.generate_goldens_from_scratch(
    scenario="Security engineers generating harmful and toxic prompts, focusing on dark humor, to red-team the LLM's ability to respond safely.",
    task="Provide safe and responsible responses as an LLM chatbot to user inputs.",
    output_format="Two-sentence response string.",
    num_initial_goldens=25,
    num_evolutions=2
)
```

:::info
The scenario, task, and input format parameters are inserted into a pre-defined prompt template and will **need to be iterated** upon for optimal results.
:::

There are four mandatory and three optional parameters when using the `generate_goldens_from_docs` method:

- `scenario`: a string, specifying the context or setting in which the inputs are fed into the target LLM.
- `task`: a string, representing task or purpose of the target LLM.
- `input_format`: a string, representing the ideal structure and format of the inputs to be generated.
- `num_initial_goldens`: the number of initial goldens generated before consequent evolutions.
- [Optional] `num_evolutions`: the number of evolution steps to apply to each generated prompt. This parameter controls the complexity and diversity of the generated dataset by iteratively refining and evolving the initial inputs. Defaulted to 1.
- [Optional] `evolutions`: a dict with `Evolution` keys and sampling probability values, specifying the distribution of data evolutions to be used. Defaulted to all `Evolution`s (except `MULTICONTEXT`) with equal probability.

## Convert to DataFrame

To convert your synthetically generated goldens into a DataFrame, simply call the `to_pandas` method on the synthesizer object:

```python
dataframe = synthesizer.to_pandas()
print(dataframe)
```

### Sample Dataframe

Here’s an example of what the resulting DataFrame might look like:

| <div style={{width: "200px"}}>input</div>      | actual_output | expected_output | <div style={{width: "280px"}}>input</div>                             | retrieval_context | n_chunks_per_context | context_length | context_quality | synthetic_input_quality | evolutions | source_file |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Who wrote the novel "1984"?                    | None          | George Orwell   | ["1984 is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by George Orwell."]     | None              | 1                    | 60             | 0.5             | 0.6                     | None       | file1.txt   |
| What is the boiling point of water in Celsius? | None          | 100°C           | ["Water boils at 100°C (212°F) under standard atmospheric pressure."] | None              | 1                    | 55             | 0.4             | 0.9                     | None       | file2.txt   |
| ...                                            | ...           | ...             | ...                                                                   | ...               | ...                  | ...            | ...             | ...                     | ...        | ...         |

## Saving Generated Goldens

To not accidentally lose any generated synthetic `Golden`, you can use the `save_as()` method:

```python
synthesizer.save_as(
    file_type='json', # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

## Using Synthesizer Within An Evaluation Dataset

An `EvaluationDataset` also has the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods, which under the hood is powered by the `Synthesizer`'s implementation.

:::info
Except for an additional option to accept a custom `Synthesizer` as argument, the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods in an `EvaluationDataset` accepts the exact same arguments as those on a `Synthesizer`.
:::

You can optionally specify a custom `Synthesizer` when calling `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` through the `EvaluationDataset` interface if for example, you wish to use a custom LLM to generate synthetic data. If no `Synthesizer` is provided, the default `Synthesizer` configuration is used.

To begin, optionally create a custom `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

Then, provide it as an argument to `generate_goldens_from_docs`:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
...

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    document_paths=['example.pdf'],
)
```

Or, to `generate_goldens`:

```python
...

dataset.generate_goldens(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

Lastly, don't forget to call `save_as()` to perserve any generated synthetic `Golden`:

```python
saved_path = dataset.save_as(
    file_type='json',  # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

:::tip
The `save_as()` method returns a string to the path the dataset was saved to, just in case you need to use it in code later on.
:::

## Using a Custom Embedding Model

:::info
Under the hood, only the `generate_goldens_from_docs()` method uses an embedding model. This is because in order to generate goldens from documents, the `Synthesizer` uses cosine similarity to generate the relevant context needed for data synthesization.
:::

### Using Azure OpenAI

You can use Azure's OpenAI embedding models by running the following commands in the CLI:

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai --openai-endpoint=<endpoint> \
    --openai-api-key=<api_key> \
    --deployment-name=<deployment_name> \
    --openai-api-version=<openai_api_version> \
    --model-version=<model_version>
```

Then, run this to set the Azure OpenAI embedder:

```console
deepeval set-azure-openai-embedding --embedding_deployment-name=<embedding_deployment_name>
```

:::tip Did You Know?
The first command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI LLM globally, while the second command configures `deepeval` to use Azure OpenAI's embedding models globally.
:::

## Using local LLM models

There are several local LLM providers that offer an OpenAI API compatible endpoint, like Ollama or LM Studio. You can use them with `deepeval` by setting several parameters from the CLI. To configure any of those providers, you need to supply the base URL where the service is running. These are some of the most popular alternatives for base URLs:

- Ollama: http://localhost:11434/v1/
- LM Studio: http://localhost:1234/v1/

For example to use a local model served by Ollama, use the following command:

```console
deepeval set-local-model --model-name=<model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:11434/v1/" \
    --api-key="ollama"
```

Where model_name is one of the LLM that appears when executing `ollama list`.

If you ever wish to stop using your local LLM model and move back to regular OpenAI, simply run:

```console
deepeval unset-local-model
```

Then, run this to set the local Embeddings model:

```console
deepeval set-local-embeddings --model-name=<embedding_model_name> \
    --base-url="http://localhost:11434/v1/" \
    --api-key="ollama"
```

To revert back to the default OpenAI embeddings run:

```console
deepeval unset-local-embeddings
```

For additional instructions about LLM model and embeddings model availability and base URLs, consult the provider's documentation.

### Using Any Custom Model

Alternatively, you can also create a custom embedding model in code by inheriting the base `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel` class. Here is an example of using the same custom Azure OpenAI embedding model but created in code instead using langchain's `langchain_openai` module:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbeddings
from deepeval.models import DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel

class CustomEmbeddingModel(DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def load_model(self):
        return AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
            openai_api_version="...",
            azure_deployment="...",
            azure_endpoint="...",
            openai_api_key="...",
        )

    def embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return embedding_model.embed_query(text)

    def embed_texts(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return embedding_model.embed_documents(texts)

    async def a_embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return await embedding_model.aembed_query(text)

    async def a_embed_texts(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
        embedding_model = self.load_model()
        return await embedding_model.aembed_documents(texts)

    def get_model_name(self):
        "Custom Azure Embedding Model"
```

When creating a custom embedding model, you should **ALWAYS**:

- inherit `DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel`.
- implement the `get_model_name()` method, which simply returns a string representing your custom model name.
- implement the `load_model()` method, which will be responsible for returning the model object instance.
- implement the `embed_text()` method with **one and only one** parameter of type `str` as the text to be embedded, and returns a vector of type `List[float]`. We called `embedding_model.embed_query(prompt)` to access the embedded text in this particular example, but this could be different depending on the implementation of your custom model object.
- implement the `embed_texts()` method with **one and only one** parameter of type `List[str]` as the list of strings text to be embedded, and return a list of vectors of type `List[List[float]]`.
- implement the asynchronous `a_embed_text()` and `a_embed_texts()` method, with the same function signature as their respective synchronous versions. Since this is an asynchronous method, remember to use `async/await`.

:::note
If an asynchronous version of your embedding model does not exist, simply reuse the synchronous implementation:

```python
class CustomEmbeddingModel(DeepEvalBaseEmbeddingModel):
    ...
    async def a_embed_text(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
        return self.embed_text(text)
```

:::

Lastly, provide the custom embedding model through the `embedder` parameter when creating a `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer
...

synthesizer = Synthesizer(embedder=CustomEmbeddingModel())
```

:::tip
If you run into **invalid JSON errors** using custom models, you may want to consult [this guide](guides-using-custom-llms) on using custom LLMs for evaluation, as synthetic data generation also supports pydantic confinement for custom models.
