**Confident AI** allows you to view and manage your monitored responses in the **Observatory**. On this page, you can inspect the ways in which these responses were generated, view entire conversational threads, view and debug traces, leave human feedback, and add unsatsifactory responses to your evaluation dataset.

While `conversation_id` is logged here, it is an optional parameter that will appear as `None` if not supplied to `deepeval`'s `monitor()` function during live monitoring.

## Viewing A Response

To view an response in more detail, simply **click on the response you want to examine**, which will trigger a dropdown panel to appear. Here, you can view the event name, Distinct ID (user ID), Conversation ID, time and completion time (automatically tracked), token cost, and token usage, as well as your usual LLM parameters, including input, response and retrieval context.

## Filtering for Responses

Filtering for responses is vital as it allows you to replay or recreate the real-world conditions of which this response was generated under. For example, with Confident AI you can easily filter for responses where data was retrieved from a particular knowledge base or data lake.

On Confident AI, you can filter responses on numerous and a combination of criteria, ranging from your Distinct (user) IDs and Conversation IDs to associated feedback information such as the rating, provider, explanation, and expected response. You can also filter responses based on the hyperparameters and custom data you have logged.

:::info
Use the date selector to choose a timeframe for the responses you wish to view. This feature is particularly useful when assigning data annotation tasks to your labelers.

Here is an example of a list of filtered responses with a rating of 1!
