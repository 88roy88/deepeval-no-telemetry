## Inspecting an Event

### 1. Click on the Event

To inspect an event in more detail, simply **click on the event you want to examine**, which will trigger a dropdown panel to appear. Here, you can view the event name, Distinct ID (user ID), Conversation ID, time and completion time (automatically tracked), token cost, and token usage, as well as your usual LLM parameters, including input, response and retrieval context.

## Filtering for Events

### 1. Selecting the filter

On **Confident AI**, you can filter events using various criteria, ranging from your Distinct ID and Conversation IDs to associated feedback information such as the rating, provider, explanation, and expected response. You can also filter events based on the hyperparameters and custom data you have logged.
