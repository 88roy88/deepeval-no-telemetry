## Quick Summary

`deepeval` allows you to live monitor LLM responses in production, which you can enable real-time evaluations on. By tracking responses, you can leverage our hosted evaluation infrastructure to identify unsatisfactory LLM responses, have human annotators send feedback to such responses, and improve your evaluation dataset over time.

## Monitor Live Responses

To monitor LLM responses, use the `deepeval.track(...)` method in your LLM application to start tracking responses.

```python
import deepeval

# At the end of your LLM call,
# usually in your backend API handler
deepeval.track(
    event_name="Chatbot",
    model="gpt-4",
    input="input",
    response="response",
    distinct_id="...",
    conversation_id="...",
    # for RAG pipelines
    retrieval_context=["..."],
    completion_time=8.23,
    token_usage=134,
    token_cost=0.23,
    fail_silently=True
)
```

The `track()` function takes in the following arguments:

- `event_name`: type `str` specifying the event tracked
- `model`: type `str` specifying the name of the LLM model used
- `input`: type `str`
- `response`: type `str`
- [Optional] `distinct_id`: type `str` to identify **end users** using your LLM application
- [Optional] `conversation_id`: type `str` to **group together multiple messages** under a single conversation thread
- [Optional] `completion_time`: type `float` that indicates how many **seconds** it took your LLM application to complete
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`: type `list[str]` that indicates the context that were retrieved in your RAG pipeline
- [Optional] `token_usage`: type `float`
- [Optional] `token_cost`: type `float`
- [Optional] `fail_silently`: type `bool`, defaults to True. You should try setting this to `False` if your events are not logging properly.

## Responses on Confident AI

Confident offers an observatory to view responses and identify ones where you want to augment your evaluation dataset with.

If you're building an LLM chatbot, you can also view entire conversation threads via the `conversation_id`.

## Enable Real-Time Evals

To monitor how your LLM application is performing over time, and be alerted of any unsatisfactory LLM responses in production, head to the "projects details" section via the left navigation drawer to turn on the metrics you wish to enable in production. Confident AI will automatically run evaluations for enabled metrics for all incoming events.
