An `EvaluationDataset` also has the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods, which under the hood is powered by the `Synthesizer`'s implementation.

:::info
Except for an additional option to accept a custom `Synthesizer` as argument, the `generate_goldens_from_docs` and `generate_goldens` methods in an `EvaluationDataset` accepts the exact same arguments as those on a `Synthesizer`.
:::

## Using Synthesizer Within An Evaluation Dataset

To begin, optionally create a custom `Synthesizer`:

```python
from deepeval.synthesizer import Synthesizer

synthesizer = Synthesizer(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

Then, provide it as an argument to `generate_goldens_from_docs`:

```python
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset
...

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.generate_goldens_from_docs(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    document_paths=['example.pdf'],
)
```

Or, to `generate_goldens`:

```python
...

dataset.generate_goldens(
    synthesizer=synthesizer,
    contexts=[
        ["The Earth revolves around the Sun.", "Planets are celestial bodies."],
        ["Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.", "The chemical formula for water is H2O."],
    ]
)
```

Lastly, don't forget to call `save_as()` to preserve any generated synthetic `Golden`:

```python
saved_path = dataset.save_as(
    file_type='json',  # or 'csv'
    directory="./synthetic_data"
)
```

:::tip
The `save_as()` method returns a string to the path the dataset was saved to, just in case you need to use it in code later on.
