If you're building conversational agents or conversational systems such as LLM chatbots, you may want to view these responses as sequential messages. Confident AI allows you to **view entire conversation threads** from the observatory page.

:::caution
This feature is only available if a `conversation_id` was supplied to `deepeval`'s track function during live monitoring
:::

## Inspecting conversations

### 1. Viewing the Conversation

To review a specific conversation thread, select the **conversation ID** on the main observatory page. This thread will display all inputs and responses of events with that conversation ID, organized chronologically.

Click the **inspect** button to further inspect each event, which triggers a "Response Details" side modal that provides detailed information about the associated event.

### 2. Leaving Feedback

You may also leave **conversation-level feedback** by clicking the top right button on the conversations page. This feedback will appear on the human feedback page.
