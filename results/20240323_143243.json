On average, lean muscle tissue \nis about 75 percent water, 18 percent protei n, and 3 percent fat. The eventual texture and taste of \nthe cooked meat depend on the amount of fat and water in the tissue and on the kinds of proteins. \nIn general, the most tender cuts of meat have more fat and less fibrous muscle. Tougher tissue \nfrom ol der animals often has more flavor. Both limitations can be overcome by using the proper \ncooking methods. Roughly 50 percent of the protein in meat comes from fibers that contract the \nmuscle and 30 percent from oxygen -storing pigments called myoglobin and v arious enzymes. The \nremaining 20 percent comes from connective tissues that hold the muscles together. Now let us \ndiscuss the composition in detail:  \nWater: Water is about 75 percent of muscle tissue.

After cooking, all vegetables, such as green beans, baked or boiled \npotatoes, and cereals, such as rice, wi ll have activated spores and must be maintained \nabove 135\u00baF or cooled to below 41\u00baF within 6 hours.  \n \nBread, batters, and pastry.  Bread and pastry dough are not as hazardous as other foods, \nbecause normally they are moderately dry. Care must be taken if a very moist product is \nproduced. Icing and protein (milk and egg) fillings can be hazardous. These fillings must \nbe cooled to 41\u00baF in 6 hours before using in items such as \u00e9clairs or custard pies. When a \nhazardous topping, such as an egg white meringue, is baked or browned, the center \ntemperature of the meringue and temperature at the interface of the pie and meringue \nmust reach 165\u00baF to kill Salmonella . The pie and meringue must be safely cooled to 41\u00baF. \nCooked mixtures should be placed in cakes, shells, cr usts, or other baked goods while still \nhot, above 165\u00baF, then the topping added, and the item baked or cooked. This controls \ncontamination on the surface of the product.  \n \nBatters (such as pancake batter) held at room temperature shall be discarded after 4  hours \nof use.  \n \nHot combination dishes.  When cooked or precooked ingredients are combined and \nreheated, they must reach a center temperature of 165\u00baF in less than 2 hours.  \n \nCold combination dishes . These foods are always a potential hazard. Wash, cook, c ool, \nand prepare all ingredients separately and start with them at a temperature such as 41\u00baF, \nso that, when combined, the temperature is less than 50\u00baF. Adding the flavoring and \nspices in the sauce or dressing before mixing ingredients will help provide u niform flavor \ndistribution. You can prepare large batches if the temperature is always below 50\u00baF, \nwhich controls the toxin production by Staphylococcus aureus.  When preparing these \nitems, always wash hands before starting and use sanitized utensils and co ntainers.  \n \nFood Transport, Holding, and Serving Hazard and Control Rules  \n \nHot holding.  To keep food at 135\u00baF or hotter, preheat equipment to 135\u00baF or hotter \nbefore adding food.  \n \nFood serving temperatures.  All foods served to customers shall be above 135\u00b0F  \n(57.2\u00b0C) [150\u00b0F (65.6\u00b0C) for quality] or below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) when they leave the service \narea. Improperly cooked, warmed, or held food, or food that shows signs of deterioration, \nis rejected.  \n "
