Consequently, meat should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. Raw meat and \npoultry are stamped with \u2015use by\u2016 dates on the packaging; they should be cooked or frozen by \nthis date. After cooking, ground meat can be stored up to 2 days, and whole cuts of meat can be \nstored for 3 to 5 days.  \nRefrigerated: Meats are best refrigerated at just a bove freezing (32\u00b0F/0\u00b0C), between 32\u00b0F and \n36\u00b0F (0\u00b0C \u20132\u00b0C). They do not freeze until the temperature drops to below 28\u00b0F (\u22122\u00b0C). The best \nplace to store meats in the refrigerator is in the coldest part. Many refrigerators have such an area \nor a compartment reserved for meat storage.  \nWrapping Meat: Most retail meats are packaged with plastic wrap and can be refrigerated in \ntheir original wrap for up to 2 days. After that time, the store wrapping should be removed and \nreplaced by loosely wrapped plastic wrap, wax paper, or aluminum foil. Leaving the tight store \nwrapping on meat for more than 2 days creates moist surfaces, which promote bacterial growth \nand deterioration of the meat.  \nControlled -Atmosphere Packaging (CAP): One alternative to storing meats for lo ng periods of \ntime at refrigeration temperatures is a patented, controlled atmosphere package (CAP) available \nonly to meat wholesalers. It can extend the shelf life of fresh red meat from the current 2 days to \nup to 28 days. The process involves using a sp ecial package that allows the removal of oxygen \nand its replacement with a mixture of 70% nitrogen and 30% carbon dioxide.  \nFrozen: Meats to be frozen should be wrapped tightly in aluminum foil, heavy plastic bags, or \nfreezer paper and stored at or below 0\u00b0 F (\u221218\u00b0C) (Figure 7 -25). It is a good idea to first trim meat \nof bone and fat and to divide it up into individual servings before wrapping and freezing it. Most \nbeef cuts can be kept frozen for 6 to 12 months, but ground beef should be frozen for no longer  \nthan about 3 months (see back inside cover of this book). The colder temperatures reached by \ncommercial freezers for at least 20 days at 5\u00b0F (\u221215\u00b0C) can kill T. spiralis . If not frozen to this \ndegree, pork should always be cooked to the recommended temper ature of 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). \nWrappers often hide the identity of their contents, so the packages of frozen foods should be \nlabeled and dated. It is better to make more frequent purchases than to freeze meat for extended \nperiods of time, which can reduce its qual ity. The texture and flavor of thawed meats will be \nadversely affected if they are refrozen. Freezer burn, caused by loss of moisture from the frozen \nfood\u2018s surface, can result if meat is stored longer than the recommended storage time or wrapped \nin materi als that are not vapor proof or are punctured. The dehydration of freezer burn causes a \ndiscolored surface on the meat that becomes very dry, tough, and somewhat bitter in flavor when \ncooked.  \nCHECK YOUR PROGRESS -VI \nQ.1 What do you mean by aging?
