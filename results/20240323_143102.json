The same is true of so -called variety meats \u2014 brain, heart, kidney, liver, tripe, and tongue. \nWhereas Americans once needed to make use of every part of a slaughtered animal, the \nabundance of food, along with changing tastes and attitudes, has made variety meats only rare \nadditions to meals.  \nMeat is composed of three basic materials: water, protein, and fat. On average, lean muscle tissue \nis about 75 percent water, 18 percent protei n, and 3 percent fat. The eventual texture and taste of \nthe cooked meat depend on the amount of fat and water in the tissue and on the kinds of proteins. \nIn general, the most tender cuts of meat have more fat and less fibrous muscle. Tougher tissue \nfrom ol der animals often has more flavor. Both limitations can be overcome by using the proper \ncooking methods. Roughly 50 percent of the protein in meat comes from fibers that contract the \nmuscle and 30 percent from oxygen -storing pigments called myoglobin and v arious enzymes. The \nremaining 20 percent comes from connective tissues that hold the muscles together. Now let us \ndiscuss the composition in detail:  \nWater: Water is about 75 percent of muscle tissue. With such a high percentage of water, you can \nsee why shrinkage can be a big problem in cooking meat. Too much moisture loss means dry \nmeat, loss of weight, and loss of profit.  "

They \ntherefore assume a place of very great importance in \nthe diet of individuals and in the plans of the \nhousewife who has all the meals to prepare for her \nfamily. In fact,  there is scarcely a meal, except \nbreakfast, at which vegetables are not served. For \ndinner, they form a part or all of each course in the \nmeal, except, perhaps, the dessert, and occasionally \nthey may be used for this. Although two or more \nvegetables are n early always served in even a simple \nmeal, the use of vegetables in most households is \nlimited to those few varieties which are especially \npreferred by the family. As a rule, there are a \nnumber of other vegetables that would be very \nacceptable if prepared in certain appetizing ways. \nAn effort should therefore be made to include all \nsuch vegetables in the dietary, for they may be used \nto decided advantage and at the same time they \nafford variety in the meals. The constant demand for \nvariety in this food make s acceptable new recipes \nfor the preparation of the vegetables already known and information for the use of the unfamiliar \nkinds. Because they are so perishable, vegetables require extra care from receiving to service. \nFreshness   is their most appealing a nd attractive quality, and one must be especially careful to \npreserve it.
